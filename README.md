## Professional Resume

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed several skills which allow me to have a proper interaction in any social environment, where activities concerning my knowledge area are performed. Competences such as: methodology, time administration, research, teamwork and leadership. This skill set drives me in the right direction to achieve optimal solutions to challenging situations related to the engineering field, and beyond.

My main goal is to achieve a professional development right from the start of my career, in order to settle down the basis of my professional horizons. I believe I will achieve this development relying on my abilities and adapting as required by the industry.

## Work Experience

**Vinco Orbis:** *Android Developer Jr.* | (June 2019 - August 2019)
* **Sura:** I provided support to the [Findo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mx.sura.inversiones.findo&hl=en) application. My principal activities were making UI corrections, adding new functionalities, and integrating some Sura's libraries for Android.

**Wizeline:** *Software Enginer (Mobile-Android)* | (Sepember 2019 - Present)
* **Fox:** I worked in the creation of common internal components (Android libraries) used by the products of the Fox chain. The goal of this project was to standardized the consume of common services in all of the Fox applications. Also, what this project looked for was to minimze the memory leaks, the workload of the Fox servers, to simplify the integration of services and to speed up the creation of new future products. My responsabilities were including new functionalities to the componentes, creating unit and integration tests, updating docs, making code reviews, a few refactor, etc. I worked closely with the Fox Android team, so all the interactions and communications were completely in english.
