## Professional Resume

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed several skills which allow me to have a proper interaction in any social environment, where activities concerning my knowledge area are performed. Competences such as: methodology, time administration, research, teamwork and leadership. This skill set drives me in the right direction to achieve optimal solutions to challenging situations related to the engineering field, and beyond.

My main goal is to achieve a professional development right from the start of my career, in order to settle down the basis of my professional horizons. I believe I will achieve this development relying on my abilities and adapting as required by the industry.

## Work Experience

**Vinco Orbis:** *Android Developer Jr.* | (June 2019 - August 2019)
* **Sura:** I provided support to the [Findo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mx.sura.inversiones.findo&hl=en) application. My principal activities were making UI corrections, adding new functionalities, and integrating some Sura's libraries for Android. This application was based on **Clean Architecture**, having a huge focus in reactive programming using **RxJava**. Also, some other libraries were used in this project, such as: **OkHttp**, **Crashlytics** and **Picasso**, and for testing: **JUnit**, **Espresso** and **Robolectric**.

**Wizeline:** *Software Enginer (Mobile-Android)* | (Sepember 2019 - Present)
* **Fox:** I worked in the creation of common internal components (Android libraries) used by the products of the Fox chain. The goal of this project was to standardized the consume of common services in all of the Fox applications. Also, what this project looked for was to minimze the memory leaks, the workload of the Fox servers, to simplify the integration of services and to speed up the creation of new future products. My responsabilities were including new functionalities to the componentes, creating unit and integration tests, updating docs, making code reviews, a few refactor, etc. I worked closely with the Fox Android team, so all the interactions and communications were completely in english. Also, this project implemented a custom architecture. The code should be as clean as possible, so the amount of used libraries was minimized, and only **OkHttp**. **Kotlin Coroutines**, and **Androidx** dependencies were used.

* **Foodie:** I worked on a Wizeline internal service used for the catering service. This project allowed the users to choose their favorite meals for the whole laboral week in Wizeline. This project was seen as an extension of an already existing web service, and was expanded with a serie of improvements made possible thanks to the Android Framework (reminders, optimization of network calls, caching). This project was based on **Clean Architecture**, using the **MVVM** design pattern, which allowed me to include a reactive code in an UI level. Also, this project uses **Apollo**, an Android **GraphQL** client, in addition to **Koin** dependency injector and **Kotlin Coroutines**.

* **Foodie (Flutter version):** In collaboration with other team members, the Wizeline Flutter Study Group was created. This little team is dedicated to teach and learn Flutter in an open community, where anybody can contribute with new ideas, architecture patterns, testing techniques, and other topics related to the crossplatform framework Flutter. We built a new version of Foodie using Flutter in order to learn Flutter in a more real way, learning from other experienced developers and sharing the experience of a real Flutter project. Also, with this project, we generated the app for both Android and iOS platforms. Some of the tools used in this project were: **BloC pattern**, **Staggered Animations**, **Internationalization**, and more.
