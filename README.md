## Profile
Android Engineer focused on the best practices of the Modern Android Development (MOD for short). During my career, I've focused most of my efforts in learning, implementing and analyzing several kind of architectures applied to Android projects, from MVP to the most modern reactive architectures, such as MVI. Also, I've spent some time to learn core ideas and concepts from other areas (specially backend development), in order to be able to perform in a smoother way while working in a multidisciplinary team.

## Employment History

**Vinco Orbis:** *Android Developer Jr.* | (June 2019 - August 2019)
* **Sura:** I provided support to the Findo application. To this day (last update, March the 3rd, 2022), this application is no longer available on the Google Play Store. The main goal of this app was to encourage the children to create their own saving fund, managed by their parents, by providing completing challenges to earn some extra money. My main activities were making UI corrections, adding new functionalities, and integrating some Sura's libraries for Android. This application was based on **Clean Architecture**, having a huge focus in reactive programming using **RxJava**. Also, some other libraries were used in this project, such as: **OkHttp**, **Crashlytics** and **Picasso**, and for testing: **JUnit**, **Espresso** and **Robolectric**.

**Wizeline:** *Software Engineer III, Android* | (Sepember 2019 - September 2021)
* **Fox:** I worked in the creation of common internal components (Android libraries) used by the products of the Fox television channel. The goal of this project was to standardized the consume of common services in all of the available products. Also, what this project looked for was to minimze the memory leaks, the workload of the Fox servers, to simplify the integration of services and to speed up the creation of new future products. My responsabilities were including new functionalities to the componentes, creating unit and integration tests, updating docs, making code reviews, some refactors, etc. I worked closely with the Android team located in California, so all the interactions and communications were completely in English. Also, this project implemented a custom architecture. The code should be as clean as possible, so the amount of used libraries was minimized, and only **OkHttp**. **Kotlin Coroutines**, and **Androidx** dependencies were used.

* **Foodie:** I worked on a Wizeline internal service used for the catering service. This project allowed the users to choose their favorite meals for the whole laboral week in Wizeline. This project was seen as an extension of an already existing web service, and was expanded with a serie of improvements made possible thanks to the Android Framework (reminders, optimization of network calls, caching). This project was based on **Clean Architecture**, using the **MVVM** design pattern, which allowed me to include a reactive code in an UI level. Also, this project uses **Apollo**, an Android **GraphQL** client, in addition to **Koin** dependency injector and **Kotlin Coroutines**.

* **Foodie (Flutter version):** In collaboration with other team members, the Wizeline Flutter Study Group was created. This little team is dedicated to teach and learn Flutter in an open community, where anybody can contribute with new ideas, architecture patterns, testing techniques, and other topics related to the crossplatform framework Flutter. We built a new version of Foodie using Flutter in order to learn Flutter in a more real way, learning from other experienced developers and sharing the experience of a real Flutter project. Also, with this project, we generated the app for both Android and iOS platforms. Some of the tools used in this project were: **BloC pattern**, **Staggered Animations**, **Internationalization**, and more.

* **Infobae**: I created a new Android application from scratch, using different technologies. This project represented a corner stone in my career, since it was my first solo project in Wizeline.

* **E-Commerce Company:** I worked with the Android team of an extense e-commerce company. My principal main responsability was to add new technologies available for Android development environment to the app, in order to modernize the codebase. For example, created a new refactored version of one of the most important screens in the app, using a new architecture and new tools for the Android Development.

**Etsy:** *Software Engineer II, Android* | (September 2021 - Present)

Etsy is my current workplace, and, as a product company, I've been working principally with the Etsy 
Android app code base. My first task was to create a new refactored version of listing screen, one of the most (if not the most) important screen in the app. And I'm currently working in the Modernization team, which main responsability is to keep the code updated with the latest Android libraries, methodologies, and frameworks.
